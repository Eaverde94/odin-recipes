    <h2>The Perfect Appetizer</h2>
    <p>From burritos to quesadillas, you really can’t go wrong with chicken wrapped in a tortilla! Flautas are our new favorite obsession. Made with shredded chicken wrapped in flour tortillas and then pan-fried, they’re somewhere between taquitos and chimichangas. They come together quickly, making them perfect party appetizers or a great weeknight meal served with Mexican rice and beans.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of chopped green chiles</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded cheddar</li>
    <li>1 cup of queso blanco</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp of kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tsp of hot sauce</li>
    <li>10 corn or flour tortillas</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of vegetable  or canola oil</li>
</ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, chiles, cheeses, salt, and hot sauce (if using).</li>
    <li>Lay 1 tortilla down on a work surface. Spread a heaping 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Roll up tightly and place seam side down on a plate. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
    <li>In a 10” skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches between 350-375 degrees F. (You want to hear a sizzle as soon as the food hits the oil.)</li>
    <li>Add 3 of the flautas to the oil, seam side down. Cook, turning every 30 to 60 seconds, until golden all over, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer flautas to a large paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Repeat with remaining flautas. Serve immediately with pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.</li>
